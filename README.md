> [!CAUTION]
> **BETA:** The project is unstable. APIs, UI, and behavior will change. Do not use in production.

> [!NOTE]
> **TypeScript:** With 280+ API routes, Nuxt's typed routes cause "Type instantiation is excessively deep" errors. We use `@ts-expect-error` as a workaround until [nuxt/nuxt#33005](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33005) (Nitro v3) ships.

XyraPanel is a game management panel similar to Pterodactyl, but built with modern technologies and today’s community expectations in mind.
